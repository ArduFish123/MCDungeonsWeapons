## Important Notes
The code that was used for this mod, excluding the JSON files that were used for the models, are under the MIT license. The art is also not covered by the MIT license. Kai1907 gave explicit permission to use his art for this project. The JSON files for the models were created by Kai1907 using BlockBench and some of them were tweaked by me to make sure that they worked with the mod.
